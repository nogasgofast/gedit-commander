Not gedit-commander
If your looking for gedit-commander it's over at: alexkv/gedit-commander
This project was forked from there.

*under construction*

One of may favorite text editors of all time had a utility 
that allowed me to edit the contents of the file i was looking at in whole. *scribes*

Although commander is close, it's objectives are different instead attempting 
to create an entirely new plugin eco system.

My Ideal workflow is: 
1. take the whole document in as input 
2. pipe that input to standard-in for commands. 
3. replace the entire file contents or make a new file.
4. Optionally close the command window to get out of the way.

The benofit? You can make use of all of the functions you get with bash,
which is already robust and well understood. With the added benofit of 
not needing to mess with input and output files. Making it more useful then 
bash. And a lot faster then a average text editor. 

And there would be no need for much documentation. In example:
1.open command terminal
2. type: sort -k3
3. hit enter and your document is sorted by column 3 and the 
applet is gone allowing you to type without the app stealing text.

At least that's the idea. We'll see if I can make it work.
